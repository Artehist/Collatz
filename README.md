# Collatz
The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

This is a script on Python which proves this conjective. All code is open to edit, so you can use this program for personal goals. 
This code works only one time and don't have any loops for multiple work.
This code so small (only 11 strings without space), so you can run it even at very low PC.
